This is my first project using modules and factory functions too (albeit in a small way).

I feel like my code is very cluttered with probably some overlap in the modules, but overall I found it to be a good way of working. I definitely found there was much less troubleshooting as all variables are contained and safe in their modules.

I think I will come back to this project at some point to make it more mobile friendly, as so far I have been testing solely on a desktop.ff
